If songs.db. contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, we can use the fields danceability, energy,loudness and calculate a number and then use that number range to represent specific colors and determine their aura based on the calculated color.

In order for the aura to be more representative of the user, we can include even more fields in our calculation and arrive at even more accurate representation.
